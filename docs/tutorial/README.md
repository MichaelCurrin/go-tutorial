# Tutorial

How to setup a new project.

This demonstrates how to install modules and run scripts, rather than a good structure for large projects.

Instructions followed:

- https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started

I find that very verbose especially when reading a second time - so I've distilled the instructions into docs in this directory and as scripts in this project.

Package used:

- https://pkg.go.dev/rsc.io/quote

See also my [Go Cheatsheets](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/go/), which is a quick reference that assumes you've gone through a tutorial already for detailed explanations.
