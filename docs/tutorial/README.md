# Tutorial

How to setup a new project.

This demonstrates how to install modules and run scripts, rather than a good structure for large projects.

## Original instructions

These instructions were followed:

- [Getting Started](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started) tutorial in Go docs.

I find that very verbose, especially when reading a second time. So I've distilled the instructions into docs in this directory and as scripts in this project.

## Dependencies

Package used:

- [quote](https://pkg.go.dev/rsc.io/quote)


## Resources

See [Go Cheatsheets](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/go/), which is a quick reference that assumes you've gone through a tutorial already for detailed explanations.

See [Go Resources](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-resources/resources/go/).
